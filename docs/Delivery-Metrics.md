# Delivery Metrics - PRAVADO Platform

## Overview

This document describes the delivery pipeline metrics tracked through PostHog events and provides guidance on how to interpret and act on these metrics.

## Core Metrics

### 1. Lead Time for Changes

**Definition:** Time from first commit to production deployment

**Measurement:**
- Start: `dev_pr_opened` event timestamp
- End: `dev_production_deployed` event timestamp
- Target: < 2 hours for hotfixes, < 24 hours for features

**PostHog Query:**
```javascript
// Lead time calculation
events
  .where(event === 'dev_production_deployed')
  .join(events.where(event === 'dev_pr_opened'), on: 'pr')
  .select(timestamp_diff as lead_time_hours)
```

### 2. Deployment Frequency

**Definition:** How often we deploy to production

**Measurement:**
- Count of `dev_production_deployed` events per day/week
- Target: Multiple times per day (high-performing teams)

**Tracking:**
```typescript
// Daily deployment frequency
SELECT 
  DATE(timestamp) as deploy_date,
  COUNT(*) as deployments_count
FROM posthog_events 
WHERE event = 'dev_production_deployed'
GROUP BY deploy_date
ORDER BY deploy_date DESC
```

### 3. Change Failure Rate

**Definition:** Percentage of deployments causing production failures

**Measurement:**
- Failed deployments / Total deployments * 100
- Target: < 15% (high-performing teams < 5%)
- Tracked via `dev_deployment_failed` events

**Calculation:**
```typescript
const failureRate = (failed_deployments / total_deployments) * 100;
```

### 4. Time to Restore Service

**Definition:** Time to recover from production incidents

**Measurement:**
- Start: `dev_incident_detected` or `dev_deployment_failed`  
- End: `dev_service_restored` event
- Target: < 1 hour for critical services

## Pipeline Metrics

### PR Processing Time

**Stages tracked:**
1. `dev_pr_opened` → `dev_ci_started` (Queue time)
2. `dev_ci_started` → `dev_ci_passed` (CI execution time)  
3. `dev_ci_passed` → `dev_integration_queue_entered` (Review time)
4. `dev_integration_queue_entered` → `dev_integration_ci_passed` (Integration time)

**Targets:**
- Queue time: < 2 minutes
- CI execution: < 10 minutes  
- Review time: < 4 hours (business hours)
- Integration: < 15 minutes

### Size Distribution Analysis

**PR Size Tracking:**
```typescript
// PR size distribution
interface PRSizeMetrics {
  XS: number; // < 50 lines
  S: number;  // 50-199 lines  
  M: number;  // 200-499 lines
  L: number;  // 500-999 lines
  XL: number; // 1000+ lines
}
```

**Optimal Distribution:**
- XS: 40% (quick wins, bug fixes)
- S: 35% (small features)
- M: 20% (medium features)
- L: 4% (large features, refactoring)
- XL: 1% (architectural changes)

### Integration Queue Performance

**Key Metrics:**
- Queue depth (PRs waiting)
- Success rate (% of clean integrations)
- Average processing time
- Failure causes breakdown

**Tracking:**
```typescript
interface QueueMetrics {
  queue_depth: number;
  success_rate: number;
  avg_processing_time_minutes: number;
  failure_reasons: {
    test_failures: number;
    merge_conflicts: number;
    build_failures: number;
    security_issues: number;
  };
}
```

## Security & Quality Metrics

### Security Scan Results

**Tracked Events:**
- `dev_security_scan_started`
- `dev_security_scan_passed` 
- `dev_security_scan_failed`

**Key Metrics:**
- Scan success rate
- Vulnerabilities found by severity
- Time to remediation
- False positive rate

**Vulnerability Tracking:**
```typescript
interface SecurityMetrics {
  scans_total: number;
  scans_passed: number;
  vulnerabilities_found: {
    critical: number;
    high: number;
    medium: number;
    low: number;
  };
  false_positives: number;
}
```

### Test Coverage Trends

**Properties tracked:**
- `coverage_percent` (overall coverage)
- `coverage_delta` (change from baseline)
- `tests_added` (new test count)
- `tests_modified` (changed test count)

**Targets:**
- Overall coverage: > 80%
- New code coverage: > 90%
- Coverage trend: Stable or improving

## Cost Metrics

### CI/CD Pipeline Costs

**Tracked Properties:**
- `ci_duration_s` - CI execution time
- `est_cost_usd` - Estimated compute cost
- `worker_deploy_cost` - Cloudflare Worker charges
- `pages_deploy_cost` - Cloudflare Pages charges

**Monthly Cost Breakdown:**
```typescript
interface MonthlyCosts {
  github_actions: number;    // CI/CD compute
  cloudflare_workers: number; // API hosting
  cloudflare_pages: number;   // Frontend hosting
  external_tools: number;     // Codecov, etc.
  total: number;
}
```

### Efficiency Metrics

**Cost per deployment:**
```typescript
const costPerDeployment = totalMonthlyCost / deploymentsPerMonth;
```

**Time value optimization:**
```typescript
const developerTimeValue = (developerHourlyRate * hoursWaitingForCI);
const optimizationROI = developerTimeValue / infrastructureCost;
```
