## USAGE STRATEGY

### **For Current Phase 1 Development:**
```
Load: CLAUDE-CORE.md + CLAUDE-UX-ARCHITECTURE.md + CLAUDE-PHASE-FOCUS.md
Total: ~10K tokens - optimal for UI development
```

### **For Backend Integration:**
```
Load: CLAUDE-CORE.md + CLAUDE-DATA-CONTRACTS.md + CLAUDE-PHASE-FOCUS.md
Total: ~11K tokens - database and API focus
```

### **For AI Feature Development:**
```
Load: CLAUDE-CORE.md + CLAUDE-AI-ORCHESTRATION.md + CLAUDE-PHASE-FOCUS.md
Total: ~12K tokens - AI strategy and implementation
```

## KEY ADVANTAGES

1. **Modular Loading** - Load only relevant context for current task
2. **Token Optimization** - Keep under 12K tokens for best performance
3. **Phase Alignment** - Context matches current development priorities
4. **Comprehensive Coverage** - All aspects of platform covered without redundancy
