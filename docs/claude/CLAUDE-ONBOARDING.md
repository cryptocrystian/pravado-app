  limitations: 'strategic_preview_only';
  valueDemo: {
    companyAnalysis: 'ai_generated_insights';

    prValueEstimate: '$150K_potential_calculated';
  };
  immediateWow: [

    "AI found 23 content gaps your competitors missed...", 
    "Here's the exact pitch that got TechCrunch coverage...",

}
```

### **Phase 2: Strategic Limitations Revealed (2-3 minutes)**

    scarcity: "Limited time: 40% off if you upgrade in next 2 hours";
    urgency: "This strategy expires when your trial ends in 20 minutes";
  };
}
```

### **Phase 3: FOMO Activation (15-20 minutes)**
